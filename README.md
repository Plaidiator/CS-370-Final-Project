# CS-370-Final-Project
#### Brandon Kelfstrom


For this project, I was given base code for the function of the game. 
I also got a file with the initial code for the artificial intelligence. 
I was responsible for creating code to make the neural network run and implement the reinforcement learning. 
I optimized values given to the program to make it run as efficiently as possible. 

Throughout this class, I have learned the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and how to create and train a machine learning model to perform certain functions. 
These skills are more important now than ever with the rapidly growing use of machine learning in applications. 
Another skill I learned was optimizing AI algorithms. 
Many uses of this technology have enormous hardware requirements. 
When an algorithm is run constantly over multiple instances, even small improvements in performance can reduce time, power, or hardware usage by significant margins. 
Understanding how each control variable affects the performance of algorithms can minimize costs. 
I also made strides in understanding weights and biases in AI. 
For the end user, it is important to maintain a thorough understanding of how artificial intelligence processes data. 
Being able to perceive issues with data being input to the system or problems with the output of the model is crucial to improving the experience for the end user and ensuring their happiness with a program.
